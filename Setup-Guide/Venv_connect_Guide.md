# Virtual Environment Configuration Guide

This guide will help you create a virtual environment, activate it, and configure it with Jupyter Notebook extension in VSCode for your development environment.

## Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Run one of the following commands to create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv my_env
```
**or**
```bash
py -m venv my_env
```

> **Note:** Replace `my_env` with your desired environment name.

## Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

### On Windows:
```bash
my_env\Scripts\activate
```

### On Linux/Mac:
```bash
source my_env/bin/activate
```

Once activated, you should see the environment name in the terminal prompt, indicating the environment is active.
