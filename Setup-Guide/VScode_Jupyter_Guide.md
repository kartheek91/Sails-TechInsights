   - Once the download is complete, open the installer.
   - Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system:
     - **Windows:** Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.
     - **macOS:** Open the `.dmg` file and drag the Visual Studio Code icon to the Applications folder.
     - **Linux:** Follow the instructions provided on the website for your specific distribution.
4. **Launch VS Code:**
   - After installation, open Visual Studio Code.

## Step 2: Install the Jupyter Notebook Extension

## **Issue Description**
While installing `ipykernel` or other packages in a Python virtual environment on Windows, the following error may occur:

```
ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'C:\Users\<username>\<path>\requests\packages\urllib3\packages\ssl_match_hostname\_implementation.pyi'
```

### **Cause**
This issue occurs because **Windows Long Path support** is disabled, causing file paths longer than 260 characters to fail.

## **Solution**
### **Step 1: Enable Long Path Support in Windows Registry**
1. Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press **Enter**.
2. Navigate to the following path:  
   ```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem```
3. Find the entry called **LongPathsEnabled**.
4. If it doesn't exist:
   - Right-click anywhere in the right pane.
   - Select **New** â†’ **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
   - Name it **LongPathsEnabled**.
5. Double-click **LongPathsEnabled** and set its **Value data** to `1`.
6. Click **OK** and restart your computer.

### **Step 2: Enable Long Path Support in Group Policy (Optional)**
If you have Windows Professional or Enterprise:
1. Press `Win + R`, type `gpedit.msc`, and press **Enter**.
2. Navigate to:  
   ```Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System -> Filesystem```
3. Double-click **Enable Win32 long paths**.
4. Select **Enabled** and click **OK**.

### **Step 3: Reinstall the Required Packages**
1. Activate your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
   source venv/bin/activate     # For Mac/Linux
   ```

2. Upgrade `pip` and install `ipykernel` again:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install ipykernel
   ```

### **Step 4: Restart VS Code**
After completing these steps, restart VS Code and rerun your notebook.
